# @hy-sde-org/dsh-memory-extraction

**Automatic long-term-memory extraction** for DeepSeek Harness — after every
`compaction/summary` event (a checkpoint boundary), a bounded, fail-open
pipeline projects the **user-authored** text of the checkpointed range,
proposes and canonicalizes durable facts with auxiliary model calls, and
commits admitted facts into the same project memory bank `retain`/`learn`
write. Ported from the [@oh-my-pi](https://github.com/oh-my-pi) coding-agent
memory-extraction trigger; storage lives in `@hy-sde-org/dsh-memory`, which
keeps the explicit `retain`/`learn`/`memory_edit` surface as the model-facing
path (Maka's `memory_remember`/`memory_extract` verbs are intentionally
reserved, not ported).

The package is **host-plane**: it mounts as a host row (`inject:
['memory', 'llm']`, publishes nothing), opens the `memory_extraction`
control unit once per process, and observes every session's events through an
unscoped `ctx.on('session/event')` listener. Runs are per-session serialized
and never block the compaction listener. It installs as a standalone plugin
for stock DeepSeek Harness (`dsh-v0.1.2-rc.1` and later) — see
`@hy-sde-org/dsh-memory` for the install recipe and the preset example.

## The pipeline

1. **Evidence is user-authored text only** — project `user/message` events
   whose `source.kind === 'user'`; assistant text is interpretation-only; tool
   calls/results, reasoning, and plugin checkpoints are opaque. Evidence is
   bounded (12 000 chars JSON / 4 000 chars per record / 64 records) and
   **fail-closed** on overflow.
2. **Admission is verified** — proposal → admission (verbatim quote check
   against the bounded evidence + secret rejection) → canonicalization →
   re-admission, at most **3 auxiliary model calls** per range with a 60 s
   timeout; failures are contained (fail-open at the runtime boundary).
3. **The cursor only moves to a committed boundary** — empty ranges still
   advance (a no-op receipt, no model call); a failed range becomes one pending
   record retried by the next trigger and then discarded. Write order is
   items → cursor → receipt, so a crash between cursor and receipt can never
   double-process.
4. **Idempotency is deterministic** — operation id = `memory_` + sha256 of
   `{sessionId, trigger, boundarySeq}`; receipts make replays no-ops and the
   commit-side dedupe probe heals a crash between items and receipt.
5. **Subagents are excluded** — the gate re-checks after every model call and
   rejects child sessions by default (`excludeSubagents: true`).

## Use this package

The row belongs in the **host composition** — it injects host services
(`memory`, `llm`), opens the control unit once per process, and must observe
every session's events. There is no agent-preset contribution and no tool.

```yaml
# host composition (loaded before any session)
- id: memory-extraction
  name: '@hy-sde-org/dsh-memory-extraction'
  config:
    backend: sqlite           # storage backend hosting the control unit (default sqlite)
    enabled: true             # master switch (default true)
    excludeSubagents: true    # child-agent compactions never extract (default true)
    # provider: <cheap provider id>  # optional; unset uses the session's routed model config
    # model: <cheap model id>        # optional; unset uses the session's routed model config
    importance: 0.5           # bank importance for auto-extracted facts (default 0.5)
    dedupe: true              # probe the bank before committing duplicates (default true)
    timeoutMs: 60000          # auxiliary call timeout (default 60000)
```

Its storage backend must expose a `kv` facet (the shipped sqlite backend
does; storage-json does not). The engine itself is pure and testable without
cordis:

```ts
import { MemoryExtractionEngine } from '@hy-sde-org/dsh-memory-extraction'

const engine = new MemoryExtractionEngine(ports) // readGate/readEvents/read+write cursor+receipt+failure/commitItems/generate
const result = await engine.execute(snapshot)   // never throws; idempotent by operation id
```

The plugin boots asynchronously: an effect opens the control unit via
`storage.backend.<backend>.kv.open(MemoryExtractionControlStore.descriptor)`
(`memory_extraction`, version 1, tables `cursors`/`receipts`/`failures`) and
registers the `session/event` listener. A missing backend logs and leaves the
plugin inert instead of failing composition.

## Understand the implementation

- `src/evidence.ts` — bounded evidence projection, coverage planning
  (binary-search shrink, fail-closed overflow), the same-session localization
  search, and quote verification.
- `src/proposal.ts` — strict hand-rolled JSON parsers (complete /
  `search_required` / `cannot_resolve` / canonicalization), prompt builders that
  frame evidence as **untrusted data**, admission (verbatim quotes, min 4 chars,
  secret rejection, NFC + injection neutralization, 2 000-char content cap).
- `src/control.ts` — the durable cursor/receipt/failure store over one
  `KvUnit` (single write chain; heal-on-open; write ordering documented).
- `src/engine.ts` — the state machine: idempotency receipt, gate, empty-range
  advance, one-retry-then-discard, 3-call budget, commit ordering.
- `src/events.ts` — the lossy DSH event projection (user/assistant text only,
  turn tracking for localization grouping).
- `src/memory-adapter.ts` — the commit surface over `ctx.memory`: a dedupe probe,
  then `save` with `source: 'memory_extract'`, plus the gate factory.
- `src/runtime.ts` — host wiring: per-session sequential queue, generate adapter
  (`BlockAssembler`, `AbortSignal.timeout`, routed provider/model override),
  sync/async port implementations over live services.

## Model Experience

The pipeline adds up to 3 auxiliary model calls per checkpointed range with
user-authored text (proposal, optional localization, canonicalization), each
bounded by `timeoutMs`. Configuring `provider`/`model` to a cheap auxiliary
model is recommended for large deployments; when unset the session's routed
request header is used. The model never sees raw logs or tool results — only
the bounded, user-authored evidence plus a short localization context.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **One pending failure per session** (retry once, then discard) — Maka keeps
  richer failure states (e.g. evidence-growth retry), ported as a single later
  retry.
- **No persistent re-extraction** on evidence growth: a checkpoint that failed
  is retried once and then dropped.
- **Maka facets are not ported** (kind/temporal/scope/tags); every extracted
  fact lands with `source: 'memory_extract'` and the configured importance.
- **No per-verb tools**: `memory_remember`/`memory_extract` are reserved names;
  the explicit DSH memory tools remain the model-facing path.
- The dedupe probe relies on the local memory bank's `search` seeing previously
  committed rows (same-process semantics).
