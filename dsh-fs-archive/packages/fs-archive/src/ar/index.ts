// Unified archive API: one reader/writer boundary for every container format
// (zip family, tar family, asar, rar, 7z, iso, cab, cpio, rpm, ar/deb,
// lzh/arj, single-stream compressors). Format modules parse containers into
// normalized `ArchiveIndexEntry` lists; `ArchiveReader` resolves links and
// serves lazy member reads; `openArchive`/`writeArchive` are the main doors.
